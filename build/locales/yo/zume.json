    "Who owns Zúme?": "Talo ni Zume?",
    "There is no organization that is “running” the Zúme Project and the project is not an organization. It is a coalition of people who have a heart to carry out Christ’s command to make disciples of every people group on earth and expand His Kingdom to every place until His will is done on earth as it is in heaven. The idea for the project originated in a meeting of the Jonathan Project leadership but has since spread far beyond that group. The Jonathan Project is a consortium of people committed to multiplying disciples around the world.": "Kosi ibi ti zume osi.",
    "What are the three phases that are planned?": "Awon ipin meta wo la se eto re ?",
    "PHASE 1": "IPELE 1",
    "The first phase focuses on the United States and English. The initial goal is to catalyze a training group of four to twelve people per every 5,000 people in the country. Each of these training groups will be challenged to start two first-generation churches which should also reproduce. The target for the United States is to start more than 65,000 English-language Zúme groups and 130,000 churches.": "Ipin alakoko da lori ilu oyinbo.",
    "PHASE 2": "IPELE 2",
    "The second phase focuses on coaching these Phase 1 churches through the reproduction process, as well as delivering the project in other major world languages. The project will start in the following languages: Ahmaric, Arabic, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Burmese, Chinese (Mandarin), Chinese (Cantonese), Farsi, French, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Panjabi (Eastern), Panjabi (Western), Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Yoruba.": "Ipin keji da lori ikeko nipa awon soosi, ati lati jise agbese pelu awon ede miran. fun apere:  Ahmaric, Arabic, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Burmese, Chinese (Mandarin), Chinese (Cantonese), Farsi, French, German, Gujarati, Hausa, Hindi, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Oriya, Panjabi (Eastern), Panjabi (Western), Portuguese, Russian, Somali, Spanish, Swahili, Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Urdu, Vietnamese, Yoruba.",
    "PHASE 3": "Ipin keta",
    "The third phase focuses Phase 1 and Phase 2 churches to mobilize globally with a vision to make disciples in every place, among every people group. Zúme Project exists to saturate the globe with multiplying disciples in our generation. To accelerate our mission, we have developed and will deliver a mapping solution allowing teams to work strategically towards the goal of a Zúme training group and two simple churches among every 50,000 people outside the US.": "Ipin keta da lori ipin alakoko ati elekeji.",
    "Why is it called Zúme?": "Kini idi ti won fin pe ni Zume?",
    "Zúme means yeast in Greek. In Matthew 13:33 Jesus is quoted as saying, “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a woman who took yeast and mixed it into a large amount of flour until it was all leavened.” This illustrates how ordinary people, using ordinary resources, can have an extraordinary impact for the Kingdom of God. Zúme aims to equip and empower ordinary believers to reach every neighborhood.": "Itumo Zume ni iwukara ni ede Giriki.",
    "What languages will the training be translated into?": "Ede wo ni awon egbe yoo mo lo?",
    "How are the groups started by trainees aligned or organized?": "Bawo ni egbe nan se bere ?",
    "It depends. If the trainees come out of a particular church or denomination or network then the most natural thing is for the newly formed groups to be connected with those existing churches, denomination, or network. If desired, however, a new network can be formed from the groups that start. A third alternative would be for the new groups to join with other already existing networks of simple churches. Many of the people involved in developing Zúme come from such networks so we can help arrange that if desired.": "Kooshi",
    "Who can see my Three-Month Plan?": "Talo le ri eto olosu meta mi?",
    "Only you see your plan, unless you link it to your group, then the group leader and coleaders will be able to see your Three-Month Plan. Your plan will also be visible to your coach.

    "Yes, you can go back to your plan at any time and edit it. Make sure you click, \"Save\" at the bottom of your plan.": "O le yi ipinu pada.",
    "Does Zúme offer a way for me to chat with people in my group?": "Se zume a je kin le ba awon egbe mi soro?",
    "Not at this time. We recommend that every member of your group create a login and get added to your Zúme group. This way every member will have access to all of the material whenever they want. Then the group can use any messaging platform that they prefer (iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook group, etc.) for further group communication.": "Koi se iru asiko yi, ni ki awon egbe re ma ni nomba.",
